If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don\u2019t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p> <note> <p>To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p> </note> <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p> </note> <p>For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.</p>",

For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the <a>SearchFaces</a> and <a>SearchFacesByImage</a> operations.</p> <p>For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>To get the number of faces in a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p> <p>If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, <code>IndexFaces</code> indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image. </p> <p>If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the <code>OrientationCorrection</code> field. </p> <p>To determine which version of the model you're using, call <a>DescribeCollection</a> and supply the collection ID.

You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.</p> <p>You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the <code>MaxFaces</code> input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don\u2019t meet a required quality bar.
