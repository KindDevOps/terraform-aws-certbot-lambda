AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer for SFTP\u2014by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53\u2014so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer for SFTP (AWS SFTP) is easy; there is no infrastructure to buy and set up. </p>",
